Introduction
PhonePe has become a leader among digital payment platforms, serving millions of users for their daily transactions. Known for its easy-to-use design, fast and secure payment processing, and creative features, PhonePe has gained praise and recognition in the industry. The PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration project aims to gather valuable information from PhonePe's GitHub repository, process the data, and present it using an interactive dashboard that's visually appealing. This is accomplished using Python, Streamlit, and Plotly.

About PhonePe-Pulse Data:
This data has been structured to provide details of following three sections with data cuts on Transactions, Users and Insurance of PhonePe Pulse - Explore tab.

Aggregated - Aggregated values of various payment categories as shown under Categories section
Map - Total values at the State and District levels.
Top - Totals of top States / Districts /Pin Codes
All the data provided in these folders is of JSON format. For more details on the structure/syntax you can refer to the JSON Structure / Syntax section of the documentation.

Project Workflow
Step 1 -- Installing and Importing the required Libraries
Firstly install all the required extensions/libraries/modules given above, if not installed

pip install (name of the library/module)

After installing the required libraries one need to import them in the program before one can use them.

import streamlit as st
import psycopg2
import requests
from streamlit_option_menu import option_menu
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import os
import json

Step 2 -- Data Extraction - Cloning the GitHub Repository
Now one need to clone the GitHub Repository to fetch the data from the Phonepe pulse GitHub repository.

Go to Google website -> Git Downloads -> go to "https://www.git-scm.com/downloads" -> click your choice(windows, linux/unix, macOS) -> After downloaded you may install that -> After installing, we have to check whether it is properly installed or not. -> For checking, use command prompt-> In command Prompt, type git, then it shows some messages that indicates gitbash is installed successfully -> then we give the username and email for access git -> Create a New Folder -> Open vscode terminal -> Create command prompt -> Type git clone https://github.com/PhonePe/pulse.git -> Press Enter -> cloing into 'pulse' -> After cloning will be done -> check the New Folder whether the data cloned.


Step 3 -- Data Tranformation - JSON to Pandas DataFrame
Note : This step is performed in the .ipynb Python notebook that is in a Jupyter Notebook, because it is comparitively easy to visualize and tranform data in a .ipynb Python notebook as comapared to .py Python file. You can check the .ipynb notebook attached above for the code implementation of the process below.
After the Data Extraction part is completed one need to transform the data. The data that was extracted from the Phonepe Pulse Repository is in form of .json file, now we need to transform that data into Pandas DataFrame, so that we can visualize the data more efficiently in the form of table and if there are any null values we can do Data cleaning to handle those null values. One more advantage of tranforming the data into Pandas DataFrame is that we can further visualize the data in the form of graphs using the Plotly module in Python.

Here, we go through each JSON file in each folder using a for loop to convert them into a DataFrame that the rest of the program can read and understand. Iteratively accessing each folder's json files, extracting the necessary key and value pairs, and then combining them into a dataframe. For this procedure, I relied on the os, json, and pandas packages.


Step 4 -- Data Insertion - Inserting the Data into MySQL Database
Note : You can check the .ipynb notebook attched above for the code implementation of the below process.
After that one need to create a PostgreSQL Database in there local system. Now below is the Python code to connect to that SQL Database.

hostname = "your host name goes here"
database = "your database name goes here"
username = "your username goes here"
pwd = "your password goes here"
port = "your port goes here"

mydb = psycopg2.connect(host=hostname, user=username, password=pwd, database=database,port=port)
                     
cursor = mydb.cursor()
After the connection is successfully established one need to write the code to create the required tables with the required columns and insert the data that we have transformed in step-3 to the MySQL database.


Step 5 -- To create a Streamlit Application
Note : You can check the .py file attched above for the code implementation of this streamlit Application.
The result of this project is a live geo visualization streamlit dashboard that displays information and insights from the Phonepe pulse Github repository in an interactive and visually appealing manner.

The data is stored in a MySQL database for efficient retrieval and the dashboard is dynamically updated to reflect the latest data. Users are able to access the dashboard from a web browser and easily navigate the different visualizations and facts and figures displayed.

The dashboard provides valuable insights and information about the data in the Phonepe pulse Github repository, making it a valuable tool for data analysis and decision-making.

Overall, the result of this project is a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for extracting, transforming, and visualizing data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository.

The user-friendly interface is made with Streamlit, and the data is visualized using Plotly's in-built functionalities.
